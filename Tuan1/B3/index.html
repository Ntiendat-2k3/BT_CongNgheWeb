    <h2>History of Lawrence Hydropower</h2>
    <p>
      In 1874 Lawrence Kansas residents had burned all the region's wood, and
      fossil fuels were not available. Orlando Darling built a dam across the
      Kansas River north of town and strung mechanical cables from a water wheel
      to power local industries. Justin Bowersock bought the operation, naming
      it "The Bowersock Mills & Power Company" (<dfn>Bowersock</dfn>).
      Bowersock's slogan is:
    </p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.bowersockpower.com">
      Producing clean, renewable hydropower since 1874
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      "By 1885, twelve water wheels drove two flouring mills, a paper mill, two
      elevators, a twine factory, shirt factory, two machine shops, the Leis
      chemical works, two printing offices, the barb wire works and a few other
      minor industries... Rebuilding from the ice damage of 1888... Bowersock
      introduced four dynamos that turned raw power into electrical energy."
      <i>History of Bowersock Power</i>. To supplement the old 2.4 MW plant on
      the south side of the river, Bowersock recently added a new 4.6 MW plant
      on the north side.
    </p>
    <p>
      To raise funds for the new 4.6 MW plant, Bowersock signed a 25-year
      power-purchase agreement with Kansas City’s Board of Public Utilities
      (<b>BPU</b>), saying Bowersock must send BPU (annual average power) &ge;
      (80% of its total generating capacity). Instantaneous power is
      proportional to (water flow rate) × (water height difference). Because the
      river's flow varies with rainfall, the power delivered also varies. To
      maximize deliverable energy, Bowersock employs a
      <i>run-of-the-river</i> policy. This keeps the upstream water level as
      high as possible and uses whatever flow occurs with the maximum upstream
      level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Energy is stored in the height of the upstream water. By intentionally
      varying this height, Bowersock could use the stored energy to offset
      variation in local rate of consumption or renewable power generation. But
      this might compromise Bowersock's contract with BPU. Therefore:

        >Until the BPU contract ends, energy stored in the water behind the dam
        is not available to Lawrence.</span
